Comparison: Default vs. Tuned Model\n","\n","Let's compare the performance of the initial model with default hyperparameters and the best model found during our manual hyperparameter tuning

can observe that the tuned model achieved a higher test accuracy (0.9392) compared to the initial model with default hyperparameters (0.9237). The tuned model also showed a lower test loss (0.1827) than the initial model (0.2466).\n","\n","This difference in performance, although seemingly small, demonstrates the positive impact of hyperparameter tuning. By increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layers (from 128 and 64 to 256 and 128 respectively) while keeping the learning rate at 0.001, the model was able to learn the underlying patterns in the data more effectively, leading to improved accuracy and a lower loss on the unseen test set.\n","\n","This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning in optimizing the performance of a neural network model for a specific task and dataset. Further tuning or exploring a wider range of hyperparameters could potentially lead to even better results."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"zlyCdjpmQKw3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
